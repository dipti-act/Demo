# v1.1.1 verify the use of a secure software development lifecycle that addresses security in all stages of development. ([c1](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering))

## Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
### Overview

To ensure the security of the payment processing and transaction validation systems, our organization will implement a Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This approach integrates security into every phase of the software development process, from planning and design to testing and deployment.

### Requirements

The following requirements must be met to ensure a secure SDLC:

#### 1. Secure Coding Practices

*   **Use secure coding guidelines**: Developers must follow secure coding practices and guidelines, such as those provided by OWASP, to prevent common web application vulnerabilities.
*   **Code reviews**: Regular code reviews must be conducted to identify and address potential security issues.
*   **Static code analysis**: Static code analysis tools must be used to detect security vulnerabilities in the code.
